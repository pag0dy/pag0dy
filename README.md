### Hi!! 👋
-------
My name is Paulina Godoy, Fullstack Python developer and BIM tech specialist from Chile. I'm currently working as a backend developer for [Talana](https://web.talana.com/). I love to learn new things and help solve problems using open source tools. I'm always looking to collaborate with interesting projects, so feel free to contact me so we can have a chat!💬

#### My Work
* [iX web](https://pag0dy.pythonanywhere.com/) :  Simple website that allows uploading information from IFC files to a PostgreSQL database and exporting a structured xlsx report, using the [IfcOpenShell](https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell) library.
* [iX Desktop](https://github.com/pag0dy/iX) : A small python application to extract information from IFC files, producing a structured excel workbook.
* [t3](https://github.com/pag0dy/t3) : This was my solo project to graduate from Coding Dojo's FullStack Python Bootcamp. It's a web app that helps to track the time people spend on different work tasks. I hope to add more features in the future, like reports with graphics, project specific meessaging and more, so if you're intrested stay tunned!
